MoodHaus üèõÔ∏è

 **Website discription :** MoodHaus is a web application for pre-interior design planning.  
Users can browse furniture pieces in a shared **furniture catalog** created by all users, or add new furniture if it‚Äôs not available. They can then insert selected furniture pieces into their **personal moodboards** on their profile to visualize how items will look together. This makes it easier to plan, experiment with styles, and organize interior design ideas before making real-life decisions.  

‚Üí The goal behind building this application was not only to support interior design enthusiasts but also to empower everyday users to explore design possibilities in an accessible way. It combines the practicality of a furniture catalog with the creativity of mood board building, bridging the gap between inspiration and planning.
